# Arcanum-Item-Description-Project
This is a project that aim to finish Item description in arcanum because why not?

Major goal is to go thru every single item in the game and put at least basic text if not proper gamer data

Item stats always go 1st before any descriptors in case of armors and weapons

otherwise flavor text is fine too (its definitely better than nothing)

as for immersion breaking text: i would say permited for quest items, but try to tie them to character knowledge about the quest
