# Arcanum-Item-Description-Project
This is a project that aim to finish Item description in arcanum because why not?
Major goal is to go thru every single item in the game and put at least basic text if not proper gamer data
Item stats always go 1st before any descriptors in case of armors and weapons
Example:
![mrrrer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aad7e7b-270d-4b8f-b9ae-c7e6a1e1679b)

otherwise flavor text is fine too (its definitely better than nothing)
as for immersion breaking text: i would say permited for quest items, but try to tie them to character knowledge about the quest
# How can you help:
https://github.com/SCARaw/Arcanum-Item-Description-Project/issues - if you have something to add, but not a lot
or Fork the whole thing and edit-in your changes and submit contribution 
or use Discord for Arcanum: https://discord.com/invite/KT7sRzY and pass me your edit or whats not :)
# release:
currently file will work in your game as is, you just need to throw it to your arcanum folder
however in the future i plan to create proper release of the work so it will be even easier
i will most likely end with nexus mirror for this project because why not
Have fun playing the game
